    "<b>Since the text length in the corpus is quite long, even though the language model can handle a maximum input of 8,092 tokens or even longer context, such lengthy contexts can dilute the essential information that the LLM is able to process effectively.

    "To address this challenge, it is beneficial to provide the language model with only the most relevant information from the large corpus, rather than overwhelming it with the entire text.

    "<div style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><b>• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</b> This approach involves retrieving relevant information from the corpus before passing it to the language model. Techniques such as semantic search or keyword-based search (e.g., BM25) can be used to identify and extract the most pertinent sections of text. The retrieved content is then fed into the LLM, ensuring that the model receives focused and contextually relevant information for prediction.</div>\n",

      "{'id': 0, 'content': \"In a proceeding pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10, Roderick L. appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Dutchess County (Peter M. Forman, J.), dated January 13, 2017. \\u2002The order, upon a finding, made after a jury trial, that Roderick L. suffers from a mental abnormality as defined in Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.03(i) and a determination, made after a dispositional hearing, that he is a dangerous sex offender requiring civil confinement, in effect, granted the petition and directed that he be committed to a secure treatment facility for care and treatment. ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs or disbursements. In June 2000, the appellant was convicted, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted rape in the first degree for a sexual assault he committed on December 23, 1999, against the eight-year-old daughter of his then-girlfriend. \\u2002Prior to the release of the appellant from prison, the State of New York commenced this proceeding pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10, alleging that the appellant is a sex offender requiring civil management (see Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.06[a]\\u2009). \\u2002A jury trial was held, after which the jury found that the appellant suffers from a “mental abnormality,” as defined in Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.03(i) (see Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.07). \\u2002Following a dispositional hearing, the Supreme Court determined that the appellant is a dangerous sex offender requiring civil confinement (see Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.07[f]; \\u2009see also Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.03[e]\\u2009), in effect, granted the petition, and directed that the appellant be committed to a secure treatment facility and receive further treatment. Contrary to the appellant's contention, legally sufficient evidence supported the jury verdict since there was a valid line of reasoning by which the jury could conclude that the appellant suffered from a mental abnormality as defined in Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.03(i) (see Matter of State of New York v. David B., 156 A.D.3d 793, 793, 67 N.Y.S.3d 650; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Ian I., 127 A.D.3d 766, 767–768, 7 N.Y.S.3d 199; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Raul L., 120 A.D.3d 52, 59, 988 N.Y.S.2d 190). \\u2002Additionally, the verdict was not contrary to the weight of the evidence, as it was supported by a fair interpretation of the evidence (see Matter of State of New York v. David B., 156 A.D.3d at 793, 67 N.Y.S.3d 650; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Ian I., 127 A.D.3d at 768, 7 N.Y.S.3d 199). We agree with the Supreme Court's determination to admit certain hearsay evidence regarding allegations in the indictment of sexual assaults committed by the appellant against the eight-year-old child other than the count to which he was allowed to plead guilty. \\u2002That evidence was sufficiently reliable and the probative value of the evidence in assisting the jury to evaluate the experts' opinions substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect (see Matter of State of New York v. John S., 23 N.Y.3d 326, 345, 991 N.Y.S.2d 532, 15 N.E.3d 287; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Kerry K., 157 A.D.3d 172, 187, 67 N.Y.S.3d 227). \\u2002Although the court should not have admitted hearsay evidence regarding uncharged allegations of sexual assaults against the eight-year-old child's six-year-old sister, the error was harmless (see Matter of State of New York v. John S., 23 N.Y.3d at 347–348, 991 N.Y.S.2d 532, 15 N.E.3d 287; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. James M., 140 A.D.3d 1178, 1179, 35 N.Y.S.3d 374). We agree with the Supreme Court's determination to permit the grand jury minutes to be released pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.08(c) and relied upon by the experts (see Matter of State of New York v. John S., 23 N.Y.3d at 341–342, 991 N.Y.S.2d 532, 15 N.E.3d 287; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Kerry K., 157 A.D.3d at 184, 67 N.Y.S.3d 227). We also agree with the Supreme Court's determination to grant the State's application to admit into evidence the written report of its unavailable expert (see Matter of State of New York v. Leroy P., 122 A.D.3d 638, 640, 995 N.Y.S.2d 596). \\u2002Contrary to the appellant's contention, the evidence was not cumulative to the testimony of the State's testifying expert (see Matter of State of New York v. Justin D., 145 A.D.3d 735, 736, 43 N.Y.S.3d 399; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Leroy P., 122 A.D.3d at 640, 995 N.Y.S.2d 596). Furthermore, we agree with the Supreme Court's finding, after the dispositional hearing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the appellant's level of dangerousness requires confinement (see Mental Hygiene Law §\\u200210.07[f]; \\u2009Matter of State of New York v. Larry B., 113 A.D.3d 865, 867, 979 N.Y.S.2d 397).\", 'word_count': 782, 'summary_length': 260, 'explanation_length': 156, 'posture': 'On Appeal'}\n"

      "convicted in June 2000 for attempted rape of an eight-year-old. Before his release, New York State\n",
      "initiated proceedings under Mental Hygiene Law article 10, claiming he required civil management. A\n",
      "jury found Roderick L. had a \"mental abnormality\" as per Mental Hygiene Law § 10.03(i). Following a\n",
      "dispositional hearing, the court deemed him a dangerous sex offender needing civil confinement. The\n",
